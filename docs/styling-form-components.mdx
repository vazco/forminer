# Styling form components

There are multiple ways to style Forminer's components. The most common way to customize the look of the form is to custom theme of [uniforms](https://uniforms.tools/) package. There are also other ways to customize the look of the form, such as using CSS styles.

## Implementing custom theme

Forminer uses `uniforms` package to render forms. You can change the theme of components in the `Forminer` or `Form` components. To do so, you need to pass the `components` prop to the `Forminer` and `Form` components. Creating custom theme is described in the [uniforms documentation](https://uniforms.tools/docs/getting-started/custom-theme/). Imported theme can be passed to the `createDefaultComponents` function to generate the components definitions.

```tsx
import { Form, Forminer } from 'forminer';
import * as theme from './uniforms-custom-theme';

const components = createDefaultComponents(theme);

return (
  <>
    <Forminer components={components}>
    <Form
      components={components}
      /* the rest of required props */
    />
  </>
)
```

## Using CSS classes

You can also use CSS classes to customize the look of fields. If you have imported stylesheet files into your project, you can use the `className` prop to apply custom styles to the fields. Forminer editor allows you to pass custom properties to the fields, which can be used to set CSS classes. Setting custom property is available in the edit field view.

## Customizing field styles in the editor

The additional feature in the editor is setting independent styles for each field. It is available in the same view as the custom properties - edit field view.
