# Technical requirements

## Prerequistences

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version 14 or above (which can be checked by running `node -v`). You can use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for managing multiple Node versions on a single machine installed.
- [React](https://react.dev/) version 17 or above

Our current implementation uses Node.js 20. Choosing it will help you to eliminate issues related to the installation of the package and its' usage.

## Dependencies

Forminer needs one of the [uniforms themes](https://uniforms.tools/docs/getting-started/installation/). You can also create your own [custom uniforms theme](https://uniforms.tools/docs/getting-started/custom-theme/).

```
uniforms-???@4.0.0-beta.5 // One of the uniforms themes.
```
